# CRUD App
This is a CRUD App made by me, while learning CRUD and Express.


## Getting Started
Run ``yarn watch`` to watch all files and compile TypeScript to JavaScript.
Run ``yarn dev`` to start JavaScript files in the /dist folder in devloper mode.
Run ``yarn dev`` to start the server in /dist folder.
Run ``yarn start_ts`` to start the server with ts-node.
Run ``yarn dev_ts`` to start devlopment server with ts-node.
Also add ``.env`` file in the root directory.


#### Note
This project is still in devlopment.
